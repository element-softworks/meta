Create .env file in root directory of project

Misc envs
local setup: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to http://localhost:3000
Production setup: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to your base URL
add AUTH_TRUST_HOST as your root domain e.g https://saasphere.dev
add NEXTAUTH_URL as the same root domain

Database envs setup
Meta uses postgres, so get any Postgres connection string from any provider and paste it into AUTH_DRIZZLE_URL= env.
https://neon.tech/ provides free databases up to a certain limit which are good for testing environments, however I suggest a more contained environment such as Railway for production as speed will be quicker. To setup a Neon database sign up to the platform fill in the setup form with the closest region to you (IMAGE 1). Copy your connection string and paste it into the AUTH_DRIZZLE_URL env place (IMAGE 2). Ensure you have "?sslmode=require" at the end of the connection string.

Run npx drizzle-kit generate inside console
Run npx drizzle-kit push to push the schemas to your database

Email sending setup
Signup at https://resend.com, then generate a secret token at https://resend.com/api-keys
This is used to send emails for password resets, email verification, etc
Ensure you have a verified domain in your Resend account for production deployments to allow sending emails to users, if this isnt done, only the accounts email will be able to send and recieve emails by using the send email onboarding@resend.dev. Follow the steps on resend to add this domain to your DNS records for production

If you want one time payments, follow the next steps to set the components to render one time rather than subscription models. Go to app/(public)/page.tsx and change the word subscription to one-time (SEE IMAGE 7).

customer.subscription.created

https://saasphere.dev/api/webhooks/stripe. Copy this secret into your deployed STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
